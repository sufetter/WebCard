My attempt at decentralization. This project was completed after watching a guide on YouTube and was done not out of a desire to develop my skills, but out of a desire to get acquainted with new areas for me, to find out, albeit in the most basic form, how blockchain-based applications work. Much was unclear to me initially and I figured it out as I created the project. It is also worth noting that at that moment I was not interested in the quality of the frontend, both externally and under the hood. And although it turned out pretty good in the end, itâ€™s better to never look under the hoodðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿. But it was really interesting project to create.
